<h1><a href="https://embloy.com">Embloy</a></h1>

> __NOTE__: _The current prototype deployed at ***[embloy.onrender.com](embloy.onrender.com)*** can take up to 60
seconds to load due to render's server instance having to boot up after being inactive for a while._

This repository contains the backend code for our application and API, including the frontend of our web-application. We
have recently deployed an initial prototype at
***[embloy.onrender.com](embloy.onrender.com)***, although
it is not yet publicly accessible (you can already create an account, but to proceed we need to authorize you first). If
you are interested and would like to take a look, please reach out to us at
___[info@embloy.com](mailto:info@embloy.com?subject=I%20want%20to%20have%20a%20look%20at%20your%20prototype!)___

## Functionality

> __NOTE__: _This file covers the web-application. If you are looking for the API documentation instead, go to_
___[api.md](app/controllers/api/v0/api.md)___

### Filtering of Available Jobs and Creating an "Intelligent" Feed

***The FeedGenerator has been migrated to an external system after mutual agreement among the developers. Although the
details of the project are confidential, a basic understanding of its functionality is necessary to work on the Rails
backend. The enhanced FeedGenerator features a single REST API endpoint, which can only be accessed by the Rails server
via an authentication barrier. Credentials are provided on a need-to-know basis. The FeedGenerator ranks each element of
a set of jobs (or "slice") that are provided by the Rails backend. The resulting feed is then displayed to the user.***

The job feed delivers personalized job recommendations based on the user's preferences and behavior.
The user can also utilize our advanced search functionality, which includes comprehensive filtering and sorting options
for direct job exploration.

Additionally, our interactive map interface, powered by the [OpenStreetMap API](https://www.openstreetmap.org), provides
a visual overview of job opportunities.

### User Authentication

Users can set up an account with their email address and password, or choose to log in using the OAuth2.0 services
provided by Google and GitHub. Once an account is created, it needs to be verified by clicking on the email.

Passwords are instantly hashed using [bcryt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) and stored in the database as an
hash. In case a user forgets their password, it can be reset via standard email authentication.

For an optimal user experience, it is recommended to fill out the 'Preferences' field under 'My Profile'.
To log into the application, users can use the aforementioned OAuth2.0 services or enter their password.
If a user forgets their password, they can reset it by providing their email address and following the specified
procedure in the email.

### Job Posting

Authenticated user's can create new job listings/postings (including a fitting title, a short description, a high
resolution cover-image and more) and, depending on the employer's liking, also define customized CV and motivation
letter requirements.
This customization includes specifying whether a CV or a motivation letter is required for the application, and if
required, employers can also indicate their preferred file formats to ensure that the applications meet the employer's
expectations.

Other users can then view these job listings and apply for the positions.

### Managing Applications for Available Jobs

The system is capable of managing jobs and applications, supporting
basic [CRUD operations](https://www.javatpoint.com/crud-operations-in-sql), and notifying the employer when a new
application is submitted, as well as notifying the applicant when their application is accepted or rejected.

All notifications are sent via [SMTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol).
Uploaded images are stored and encrypted on a Backblaze B2 Bucket (soon to be migrated to AWS S3).

## How it Works

To get started, simply visit [our website](http://embloy.com/) and create a new account or log in with an existing
account. It's that easy!

## Running on Docker

Go into the project directory and run: \
`$ docker build -t embloy .`\
`$ docker run -it -p 3000:3000 embloy `

To deploy to docker-hub: \
`$ docker tag embloy:latest <docker-username>/<docker-repository>`\
`$ docker push <docker-username>/<docker-repository>`

## Config

> __NOTE__: _You only need to follow these steps if you wish to contribute and need to test your changes locally_

<details>
  <summary> 1. Prerequisites </summary>

- Install Ruby 3.2.2

- Install Rails 7

- Install Postgresql 16

- Open pgAdmin4

- Add a new server

</details>

<details>
  <summary> 2. Connect to our remote database </summary>

-     hostname/address: <special authorization needed>

-     maintanence database: <special authorization needed>

-     username: <special authorization needed>

-     password: <special authorization needed>

-      port: 5432

</details>

<details>
  <summary> 3. Start the server </summary>

If you wish to experiment on our backend or contribute to our front end, you can test your changes by starting a local
server.

1. Create a file 'config/env_var.rb' with the following content:

   ```
   ENV['RAILS_MASTER_KEY'] = <>
   ENV['RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES'] = <>
   # DATABASE ACCESS
   ENV['DATABASE_HOST'] = <>
   ENV['DATABASE_PASSWORD'] = <>
   ENV['DATABASE_URL'] = <>
   # ENV['DATABASE_URL'] = <>
   ENV['DATABASE_USER'] = <>
   # OAUTH2 CODES
   ## GOOGLE
   ENV['GOOGLE_OAUTH2_KEY'] = <>
   ENV['GOOGLE_OAUTH2_SECRET'] = <>
   ## GITHUB: embloy.onrender
   ENV['GITHUB_KEY'] = <>
   ENV['GITHUB_SECRET'] = <>
   # E-MAIL CREDENTIALS
   ENV['EMAIL_ADDRESS'] = <>
   ENV['EMAIL_HOST'] = <>
   ENV['EMAIL_INFO_USER'] = <>
   ENV['EMAIL_NOREPLY_USER'] = <>
   ENV['EMAIL_PASSWORD'] = <>
   # TOKEN SECRETS
   ENV['REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET'] = <>
   ENV['ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'] = <>
   # CORS CLIENT_URL
   ENV['CORS_CLIENT_URL'] = <>
   # BACKBLAZE B2 BUCKET
   ENV['BUCKET_APPLICATION_KEY_ID'] = <>
   ENV['BUCKET_APPLICATION_KEY'] = <>
   ENV['BUCKET_NAME'] = <>
   ENV['BUCKET_ID'] = <>
   ENV['BUCKET_REGION'] = <>
   ENV['BUCKET_ENDPOINT'] = <>
   ```

1. Run ``$ rails db:create`` to create all necessary tables in your development database.
2. Run ``$ rails db:migrate`` to migrate your changes to the database.
3. Run ``$ rails server`` to start the server.
4. Add the following lines manually when resetting the current database or creating a new database:

   ```
   CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
   ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN job_value public.geography(PointZ,4326);
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS job_job_value_index
   ON public.jobs USING gist
   (job_value)
   TABLESPACE pg_default;
   ```

</details>

4. Go to http://localhost:3000
